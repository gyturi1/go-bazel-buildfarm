Trying out Go and [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) with remote excution using [Buildfarm](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-buildfarm). 
You can find details and helps in the [Makefile](./Makefile)

Tried to mimick a dev env.

### Dockerized test running
I also investigated how to run "integration test" inside docker and with docker compose.
